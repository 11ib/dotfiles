My dot files
========================

These are my config files for Bash, VIM, Python, and more.

You may use them as they are, fork the repo, copy-paste what you like or suggest changes. It's under a do as you please license :)

## Intentionally simple
I really hate code or configuration that I don't understand. It might do magical things, but when things ago awry, and they do, I need to be able to fix it. In this setup, I have handwritten (or at least hand copied :smiley:) every line, and I have tried to document why the line exists if it is scary or weird in some way.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/fatso83/dotfiles
./dotfiles/setup.sh # and wait until completion ...
```

## Per machine settings

See `per-host-config/README.md`
