# don't do anything to line-endings for Windows files.  Let CRLFs go into the repo, and CRLF on checkout
*.bat       -crlf
*.ps1       -crlf
*.sln       -crlf
*.*proj*    -crlf


# To view the effect:
# $ rm .git/index     # Remove the index to force Git to
# $ git reset         # re-scan the working directory
# $ git status        # Show files that will be normalized
